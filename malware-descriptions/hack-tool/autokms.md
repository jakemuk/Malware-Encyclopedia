# AutoKMS

AutoKMS is a tool commonly associated with software activation, particularly for Microsoft Office and Windows products. While it can be used for unauthorized software activation, it is not inherently malicious or considered malware.

However, it's important to note that AutoKMS and similar tools are often detected and flagged by antivirus software as potentially unwanted programs or hack tools due to their association with software piracy. Using such tools to activate software without proper licensing is illegal and can result in security risks.

It's always recommended to use genuine and legally obtained software licenses from official sources to ensure both compliance with licensing agreements and to maintain the security and integrity of your system.
