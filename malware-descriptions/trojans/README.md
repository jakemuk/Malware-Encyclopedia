# Trojans

A Trojan, also known as a Trojan horse, is a type of malicious software or malware that disguises itself as a legitimate software or file. The term is derived from the Ancient Greek story of the wooden horse that was used to help Greek troops invade the city of Troy.

Trojans can be employed by cyber-thieves and hackers trying to gain access to users' systems. Users are typically tricked into loading and executing Trojans on their systems after receiving social engineering emails, instant messages, or by visiting malicious websites.

Once activated, Trojans can enable cyber-criminals to spy on you, steal sensitive data, and gain backdoor access to your system. These actions can include:

* Deleting data
* Blocking data
* Modifying data
* Copying data
* Disrupting the performance of computers or computer networks

Unlike computer viruses and worms, Trojans generally do not attempt to inject themselves into other files or otherwise propagate themselves. They primarily focus on creating a backdoor to give attackers access to the user's system.
