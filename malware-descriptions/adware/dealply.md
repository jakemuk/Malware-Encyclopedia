# DealPly

DealPly is a potentially unwanted program (PUP) or adware that was designed to display various types of advertisements on a user's computer. It is typically installed as an add-on or extension in web browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Internet Explorer. DealPly claims to enhance the user's online shopping experience by providing coupons, deals, and price comparisons.

However, DealPly often infiltrates a user's system without their knowledge or consent, bundled with other software downloads. Once installed, it tracks the user's browsing habits, collects data, and displays targeted advertisements based on the gathered information. These ads can appear as pop-ups, banners, in-text links, or interstitial ads on websites.

DealPly's advertisements can be intrusive and disruptive to the user's browsing experience. They may redirect users to sponsored websites or promote potentially unsafe or malicious content. Furthermore, DealPly can consume system resources and slow down the computer's performance.

Due to its unwanted behavior and intrusive nature, DealPly is generally classified as adware and is recommended to be removed from the system. It is advisable to use reputable antivirus or anti-malware software to scan and eliminate any instances of DealPly from your computer. Additionally, exercising caution when downloading and installing software from the internet can help prevent adware infections.
