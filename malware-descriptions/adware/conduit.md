# Conduit

Conduit is a well-known adware variant that has gained notoriety for its intrusive and unwanted behavior. It is often referred to as the Conduit toolbar or Conduit search engine. Conduit presents itself as a browser extension or toolbar that claims to offer customized search capabilities and enhanced browsing features. However, it is typically installed without the user's explicit consent or knowledge, often bundled with other software downloads.

Once installed, Conduit takes control of the user's browser settings, modifying the default search engine, homepage, and new tab page. It redirects search queries through its own search engine, which displays sponsored results and injects advertisements into search results pages. Users may also experience intrusive ads in the form of pop-ups, banners, or in-text links while browsing websites.

Conduit's primary objective is to generate revenue through advertising. It tracks users' online activities and collects data about their browsing habits, search queries, and interactions with websites. This information is then used to deliver targeted advertisements based on the user's interests and preferences.

The presence of Conduit on a computer can significantly impact the user's browsing experience, causing slower performance, unexpected redirects, and an inundation of unwanted ads. It can also compromise user privacy by collecting and transmitting personal information without explicit consent.

Due to its intrusive nature and unwanted behavior, Conduit is generally categorised as unwanted or potentially harmful software. It is recommended to remove Conduit using reputable antivirus or anti-malware software to restore control over browser settings and ensure a safer browsing experience. Additionally, exercising caution when downloading software and carefully reviewing installation processes can help prevent unintentional installations of Conduit or similar adware variants.
