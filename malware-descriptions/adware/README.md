# Adware

Adware, short for advertising-supported software, refers to software or applications that display advertisements on a user's device. It is designed to generate revenue for its developers by delivering targeted advertisements to users while they browse the internet or use certain applications.

Adware typically comes bundled with free software or downloaded from the internet, often without the user's full knowledge or consent. It may be included as an additional component during the installation process, and users might unintentionally agree to its installation by not carefully reviewing the terms and conditions.

Once installed, adware tracks the user's online activities and browsing habits to gather data about their interests and preferences. It then displays targeted advertisements based on this collected information. Advertisements can appear as pop-ups, banners, in-text links, or even as changes to the browser's homepage or search engine.

While some adware is relatively harmless and merely displays ads, others can be more intrusive, disrupt the user experience, slow down the device, or even pose security risks. Certain adware variants may redirect users to malicious websites, install additional unwanted software, or collect sensitive information without consent.

It is important to differentiate between legitimate advertising and unwanted adware. Users are advised to exercise caution when downloading and installing software, carefully read the terms and conditions, and use reputable antivirus or anti-malware software to detect and remove any potentially unwanted adware from their devices.
